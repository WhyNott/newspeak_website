%p Since our founding in 2015, Newspeak House has been entirely independent, not relying on funding from any other institution. This is only possible thanks to our generous members. However, this is a critical time; the pandemic has wiped out our reserves, leaving our core activities restricted and putting us at risk of closing. If there ever was a time to become a member, it is now. If you want to ensure your community can continue to benefit from the facilities at Newspeak House, please consider joining. 
%p Memberships are #{base_plan_rate} per month, charged by monthly subscription. As a member you'll enjoy access to members' only events, and have the right to book our spaces for events aligned with our mission.
