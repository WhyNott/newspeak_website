  Political Technology is the study of institutions founded with an ideological purpose (civic, political, public sector, charitable, activist, etc), the communities that surround them, and in particular the novel digital infrastructures that they produce and deploy.
%p
  This is a diverse and dynamic field that is affecting society in complex ways. To give an idea of the range and diversity of projects, some examples:

  Edward is dean of Newspeak House, responsible for setting its research direction as well as the day-to-day running of the college. His area of study is infrastructure for organising and network development, and he spends his time trying to connect up bits of civil society, or making tools to do so: chair

  Zarinah is a neuroscientist by training. After spending over a decade in academia, they left to study the science of groups of brains - that is, humans in collectivity.
%p
  Alongside their work with the college, Zarinah runs three nonprofits aimed at experimental aspects of society, collective transformation and para-institutions. The  
  %a.inline-link{:href => "https://www.socialobservatory.space"} Social Science Observatory
  is dedicated to the study of social science in the wild, 
  %a.inline-link{:href => "https://www.alternativejustices.com/"} Alternative Justices
  works towards abolitionist community-based harm prevention and response, and 
  %a.inline-link{:href => "https://www.districtcommons.org/"} District Commons
  engineers experimental spaces where humans can ‘be otherwise’. Together, these strands allow both the prefiguration of new social configurations, as well as the study of their transformational potential.
