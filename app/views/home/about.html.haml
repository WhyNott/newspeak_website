      Political Technology is the study of institutions founded with an ideological purpose (civic, political, public sector, charitable, activist, etc), the communities that surround them, and in particular the novel digital infrastructures that they produce and deploy. This is a diverse and dynamic field that is affecting society in complex ways. Some examples:

      \. While we are honoured to count many academics amongst our membership, we are primarily a practitioner college that seeks to engage directly with the field by contributing to projects and communities, and working with key institutions.

      Edward is dean of Newspeak House, responsible for setting its research direction as well as the day-to-day running of the college. His area of study is infrastructure for organising and network development, and he spends his time trying to connect up bits of civil society, or making tools to do so: chair Centre for Democracy, board member Compass, curator LCPT Library, steward docs.plus, co-author Reorganise, co-founder Data Collective, co-founder Tech for Good Organisers Network, founder Environmental Permit Data Service (coming soon!)

      Zarinah is a neuroscientist by training. After spending over a decade in academia, they left to study the science of groups of brains - that is, humans in collectivity.
    %p
      Alongside their work with the college, Zarinah runs three nonprofits aimed at experimental aspects of society, collective transformation and para-institutions. The  
      %a.inline-link{:href => "https://www.socialobservatory.space"} Social Science Observatory
      is dedicated to the study of social science in the wild, 
      %a.inline-link{:href => "https://www.alternativejustices.com/"} Alternative Justices
      works towards abolitionist community-based harm prevention and response, and 
      %a.inline-link{:href => "https://www.districtcommons.org/"} District Commons
      engineers experimental spaces where humans can ‘be otherwise’. Together, these strands allow both the prefiguration of new social configurations, as well as the study of their transformational potential.

      Stephanie is a design director, strategist, writer, and producer working across urbanism, technology, and culture.
    %p
      Her work reprograms outmoded systems as collaborative platforms, leveraging surplus, storytelling, and speculation towards strategic transitions and social technologies. She has co-founded three non-profits, collaborated with and consulted for tech companies, city governments, research groups, and civil society organisations, and produced thousands of large-scale public events and experiences across social, speculative, systems and spatial design.
