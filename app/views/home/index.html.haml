  We have survived the pandemic. It’s amazing to see you all again. However, we are not out of the woods yet. The last few years have been disastrous for community spaces. Many have closed their doors forever, and times are still tough. Please bear with us while we find our feet again. Our event programme may be a little sparse for a while, as communities that have been dormant wake themselves up. In the meantime, we have been making ambitious plans:

%h3 Future Plans
%p
  To increase our resilience as an institution and grow our impact, we are planning to open additional campuses under the umbrella brand of “The London College of Political Technology”. They will form a federated network of spaces, each hosting their own residential programme and sharing a common curriculum. If all goes well, we intend to launch our first new campus in 2024.
%p
  As part of this initiative, we are delighted to welcome two new members of our faculty:

  Zarinah is a neuroscientist by training. After spending over a decade in academia, they left to study the science of groups of brains - that is, humans in collectivity.
%p
  Alongside their work with the college, Zarinah runs three nonprofits aimed at experimental aspects of society, collective transformation and para-institutions. The  
  %a{:href => "https://www.socialobservatory.space"} Social Science Observatory
  is dedicated to the study of social science in the wild, 
  %a{:href => "https://www.alternativejustices.com/"} Alternative Justices
  works towards abolitionist community-based harm prevention and response, and 
  %a{:href => "https://www.districtcommons.org/"} District Commons
  engineers experimental spaces where humans can ‘be otherwise’. Together, these strands allow both the prefiguration of new social configurations, as well as the study of their transformational potential.

%h3 Retrospective
= image_tag('Lectern.jpg')
%p
  As we emerge from the pandemic, Newspeak House is looking to the future and how it can survive and thrive for many more years to come. A part of this is seeking constructive criticism from the communities it serves.
%p
  We understand that it can feel hard to give direct feedback, even anonymously, but we really hope that you will, as we genuinely wish to learn and improve, as well as adapt to a world that has changed significantly. We will do our best to take heed from any criticisms, wishes and visions that are shared with us.

%h3 Membership
= image_tag('terrace table.jpg')
%p
  If there was ever a time to become a member, it is now. Newspeak House has always relied on support from our membership to get us to where we are today, but the pandemic has wiped out our reserves, leaving our core activities restricted. If you want your community to be able to continue to benefit from the facilities at Newspeak House, please consider joining as a member.

%h3 Scholarships
= image_tag('isla table.jpg')
%p
  Students are now faced with higher living costs than ever before, and our bursary fund was obliterated by the pandemic. This prevents deserving candidates from applying to the course, or being able to focus on their studies. We’re absolutely awed that some community members have generously stepped forwards to offer scholarships, the first we’ve ever had.
%p
  Newspeak House is still a young, scrappy institution, and it’s a great honour for our work to be recognised in this way. We know that these scholarships will be life-changing to the recipients, and that they will go on to have great impact in their future work. Read on to find out who pledged these scholarships, and also for information on how you can join them.
