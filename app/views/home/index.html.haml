%h3 Study with us
%p
  Applications for our year-long flagship course
  %strong Introduction to Political Technology
  are now open!
%p This year, in addition to the six residential places, <b>we are pleased to offer six non-residential places on the course</b>.
%p Course participants spend a year immersed in a wide range of communities working to change society with technology, everything from civil servants, activists, charities, journalists, to researchers.
%p The course is designed to support mid-career technologists to develop a holistic understanding of the civic landscape in the UK, in order to found groundbreaking new projects or seek strategic positions in key institutions.
%p The course has run since 2015 and has graduated 76 fellows. 2024-25 is the second year in which the course will include content led by Newspeak House’s faculty, a group with broad experience in branches of political technology practice and theory including political organising, collective behaviour, open source software, and game design.
%p The course entails a commitment of approximately 16 hours per week and is designed to fit around a day job.
