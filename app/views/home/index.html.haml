%h3 Retrospective
%div.wide-pic{:style => "background-image: url(#{image_path "Lectern.jpg"})"}
%p
  As we emerge from the pandemic, Newspeak House is looking to the future and how it can survive and thrive for many more years to come. A part of this is seeking constructive criticism from the communities it serves.
%p
  We understand that it can feel hard to give direct feedback, even anonymously, but we really hope that you will, as we genuinely wish to learn and improve, as well as adapt to a world that has changed significantly. We will do our best to take heed from any criticisms, wishes and visions that are shared with us.

%h3 Scholarships
%div.wide-pic{:style => "background-image: url(#{image_path "isla-table.jpg"})"}
%p
  We’re absolutely awed that some community members have generously stepped forwards to offer scholarships, the first we’ve ever had. Students are now faced with higher living costs than ever before, and our bursary fund was obliterated by the pandemic. This prevents deserving candidates from applying to the course, or being able to focus on their studies.
%p
  Newspeak House is still a young, scrappy institution, and it’s a great honour for our work to be recognised in this way. We know that these scholarships will be life-changing to the recipients, and that they will go on to have great impact in their future work. Read on to find out who pledged these scholarships, and also for information on how you can join them.&thinsp;
