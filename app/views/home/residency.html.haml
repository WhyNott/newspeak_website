%p
  Newspeak House is a hub for communities working to change society with technology, spanning all kinds of civic institutions, including government, politics, activism, charities, journalism, think-tanks, NGOs, philanthropy, and academia.
%p
  At the heart of Newspeak House is its residential programme, running since 2015. 
  = link_to 'Seven residents', 'residents'
  spend a year immersed in these communities, enjoying the chance to meet thousands of people and attend events held on their doorstep.
%p
  The programme is designed to support mid-career technologists gain a holistic understanding of the civic landscape in the UK, in order to found groundbreaking new projects or seek strategic positions in key institutions. It’s ideal for people who have been working professionally for several years and are now looking to grow their network and spend time reflecting deeply on how they can best have impact on the world.
%p
  Residents will have the opportunity to:
%ul
  %li Be immersed in a wide variety of emerging civic communities of practice
  %li Engage with expert practitioners working in senior positions across UK institutions
  %li Develop strong relationships with a close cohort of peers while living together in centrally located college accommodation
  %li Work on your own projects with the guidance and mentorship of our faculty
%p
  A principal benefit of residency is the opportunity to engage with the collegiate environment and take an active interest in activities happening on campus. We prioritise applicants who are excited about connecting with and contributing to the work of other residents, fellows, members, organisers, and the growing communities working on political technology.
%p
  Residents should plan to spend at least sixteen hours a week focused on the course itself. This will be a mix of seminars, pair work, self-study, and attending events. Course content is re-written each year to reflect the dynamic nature of the field and the needs of the particular cohort, but broadly the first half of the year is focused on group exercises and getting an overview of the field, and the second half on developing your individual projects. Upon completing the course, you will be invited to join the

%h3 You should apply if...

%ul
  %li There are wrongs in the world that you want to set right, and you feel a personal responsibility for taking action. This has affected your career decisions, or you have some track record of volunteering or organising. You worry about whether your work has impact.
  %li You’re in an exploratory mode. There are rapid changes happening in the world that you want to get a handle on. You don't currently have a single project that you're deeply focused on, and are open to meeting and learning from people who may not obviously possess knowledge you're looking for. You’re curious about the dynamics of unfamiliar groups, communities, networks, institutions, fields, and movements. You're able to engage tactfully with many different kinds of people, whose values and approaches you may not agree with.
  %li You believe in the importance of technology for social change. You've worked on a product or service, whether solo or as part of a team. You're not afraid of getting your hands dirty and making things. This does not necessarily mean that you're a software developer - amazing what you can do with
    %a{:href => "https://www.sidelabs.org/"} no-code
    these days - but you're not put off by the idea that you might have to spend time figuring out how to build something.
  %li You enjoy meeting new people. Your best work is done in a communal setting in close proximity to others. You go to meetups for fun, perhaps you have organised one. You’re excited by the idea of spending several nights of the week attending events. You have some kind of online presence, and contribute to various online communities. You’re enthusiastic about sharing your knowledge and networks, as well as developing mentoring relationships.
  %li You bring with you a network that's not yet well represented at Newspeak House. We are looking for a diverse, interdisciplinary group that brings a mix of backgrounds, methodologies, fields, and professions — practitioners, organisers, researchers, developers, lawyers, advocates, activists, educators, entrepreneurs, journalists, technology industry actors, field builders, those coming out of a government office or position, policy analysts, public intellectuals, and those whose practice doesn’t fit squarely into conventional categories. If you’re not sure if you should apply, feel free to get in touch for a conversation about whether a residency might be right for you:

  Newspeak House is strengthened by the diversity of our network and our differences in background, culture, experience, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much more. We strongly encourage applications from people of colour, women, the LGBTQIA community, and disabled people. Unfortunately though, the lodgings offered are not wheelchair accessible, and space is not available for partners/family. Also, aside from service animals, roaming pets are not permitted.
%p
  While we welcome applications from outside the United Kingdom, we are currently unable to support the acquisition of visas. If you are applying from outside the United Kingdom and are accepted, you will need to secure your own visa and, depending on your situation, work permit.
%p
  You're welcome to reapply if you don't get selected the first time.
%p
  If you have any questions about the course or the application process, don't hesitate to reach out via

%h3 Pastoral Care
%p
  The wellbeing of our residents is of great importance to us. Newspeak House employs a chaplain and retains a pastoral board who are there to provide support for the emotional and psychological health of those who stay with us.
%p
  Even in communities where everyone has the best of intentions, things can sometimes go wrong. Our pastoral team are experienced in community harm prevention and response, and we will proactively deal with any conflicts or pastoral issues should they arise.
%p
  If you would like to know more about our pastoral provisions, please contact
