    %h2 Core Modules
  %p Core modules are mandatory activities that all students participate in throughout the year, and are taught in collaboration by the entire faculty.
  
  %h3 Governance
  %p Students learn to organise themselves to live together and act as a student body. Students have the chance to experiment with and experience different forms of governance, and develop original systems for decision-making, policy development, resource allocation, and conflict resolution.

  %h3 Fieldwork
  %p Students will engage with a broad variety of emerging civic communities of practice and understanding how they work. Students will also familiarise themselves with the landscape of political technologies through exploring the library and undertaking a grantmaking exercise.

  %h3 Institutional Analysis
  %div.profile-subtitle Dr Six Silberman
  %p In this module we will explore how institutions work (and don’t work), how they change, and how we as individuals can try to participate constructively in that functioning and change.
  %p Our main methods will be discussion and reading. The readings in this module are selected to support your practical work in other modules such as Governance and the Prototype. The readings prioritise empirical research; concepts and theories built on empirical research; and writings by practitioners. In particular, the ‘Institutional Analysis and Development’ framework developed by Elinor Ostrom and her collaborators figures prominently in the readings.

  %h3 Engineering Group Decisions
  %div.profile-subtitle Dr Joshua Becker
  %p There is no such thing as an independent individual: everything you do and know and think is shaped by other people.
  %p The overall framework for this module is one of management as engineering. The goal is to help you think like an engineer about designing team, organizational, and social processes.

  %h3 Mechanism Design
  %div.profile-subtitle Mustafa Warsi
  %p If game theory is the study of optimal decision-making by agents given a set of resources, utilities, and constraints, [i.e. given a decision architecture, how should agents behave?] then mechanism design is the study of the inverse problem, namely, given a set of desirable behaviours, how do we design a decision architecture so that agents playing this game converge to the desired behaviour? i.e if microeconomics is the science of predicting the behaviour of optimising agents, then mechanism design is an attempt to engineer that behaviour.
  %p We will first specify motivating cases, then lay out the theoretical foundations of the field in the abstract, go through some results, and then see what they can teach us about those case studies.

  %h3 Political Organising
  %div.profile-subtitle Hannah O’Rourke
  %p As technology reshapes the political landscape, traditional wisdom in political strategy is being upended. This offers huge opportunities for campaigners and political institutions, but also challenges.
  %p In this module, you will learn about the current state of political campaigning and organising in the UK and explore how this is being changed by technology. It is designed to support students to develop and operationalise their own political strategies for the causes they care about.
  %p How can you make change actually happen? What pressure points can you target? This module will teach you how to navigate the realpolitik of the political system and how to make lasting systemic political change.
  %p Alongside this, students will learn about the theoretical cutting edge of technology in organising. How do you run a decentralised campaign effectively using the platforms available? What tools are best for organising your own campaigns?
  %p Basically… how do you get stuff done in politics?!

  %h3 Open Source
  %div.profile-subtitle Theodore Keloglou
  %p The Open Source Model for Software, Governance, Democracy
  %p The Open Source model has been used in software making since the 1970s. It’s characterised by transparency, collaboration, decentralisation — values that we would like to see in other places, most importantly in the governance of our societies.
  %p This module has two parts. One part is a series of 8 lectures that focus on practical aspects of open source technology and various topics of political theory and philosophy. The second part of the module is online calls (weekly for periods of time) that give space to students to share projects, project ideas, technical aspects, questions, or any other forms they want to share.

  %h3 Service Design
  %div.profile-subtitle Sinead Doyle
  %p Service Design is a discipline that has emerged over the last thirty years, building on the foundation of User Centred Design. As we transition from a product economy to a service economy, the focus of design has shifted from the shaping of physical products, to the provision of experiences that meet a user's needs. We design end-to-end services, often through a mix of physical and digital channels, with support that extends before and after use or purchase of a product.
  %p A service is, quite simply, something that helps someone to do something. A user (or citizen) has a need: that need must be met by some combination of products and people, delivered as a series of steps over time. When we design a service, we are building the tooling that helps people get things done. Services are important: they allow people to access healthcare, travel, find jobs, get housing, manage money and achieve their goals. Good services save lives: bad services ruin lives. While Service Design has applications in all industries, it’s particularly vital in the public sector: service provision is the underlying purpose of government! As we digitise existing services, we have an opportunity to radically rethink policy and process, making people’s lives easier.
  %p In this module, we will look at how organisations meet the challenge of designing new services and iterating them. We’ll discuss the differences between product thinking and service thinking. We’ll talk about the toolkits, methodologies and artefacts that are used, and their strengths and weaknesses. There are many barriers: we’ll identify structural blockers, procurement hurdles, team shape issues and skills gaps. Finally, we’ll consider how service design needs to evolve to stay relevant in a changing world.

  %h3 Robust Software and Systems
  %div.profile-subtitle Lewis Westbury
  %p The internet is a hostile environment. Internet-facing applications face a constant stream of threats - ranging from casual scripted attacks through to sophisticated, targeted attacks. Asking users to trust you with their data is a big responsibility.
  %p In this module we’ll explore techniques for reasoning about this environment, and how to build software and systems that are reliable and protect user data.

  %h3 Game Design
  %div.profile-subtitle Sam Ballard
  %p Games are systems carefully designed to evoke specific emotions in their participants. Political regimes in the real world are in fact also such systems, albeit for different ends. What can the craft of game design teach us that is applicable to designing policy? In this module, you’ll learn some game design theory from the commercial games industry, and also get hands-on experience of making game-design decisions.

  %h3 Public Sector Innovation
  %div.profile-subtitle Andreas Varotsis
  %p If you’re at Newspeak House, you already care about how technology can improve our society for the better… but you probably also know that large public institutions like the government often fail to harness it, with seemingly simple solutions turning into colossally expensive, endlessly delayed megaprojects.
  %p So how can you improve public institutions using technology? When does it go wrong, and what can we do to try and make it work?

  %h3 Product Design
  %div.profile-subtitle Shad Gibran
  %p Once upon a time, technology wasn’t as ubiquitous as it is now. Not everyone had a phone, not everyone knew what email was. The last of those generations will fade out slowly and we’ll know a world where everybody alive on the planet is a digital native. For technology to have become as pervasive, addictive and dangerous as it is, it needs to be accessible to the masses. 
  %p Digital product design as a discipline is very new, but deeply rooted in design academia. We’ll look at the discipline from a different angle, and try to apply design thinking to the problem spaces you’re most concerned with.
  %p TLDR: How do you make something people will actually use?
